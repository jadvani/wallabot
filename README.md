# UPDATE 31/07/2022: WallaPop has changed considerably, and I will be updating the functions shortly. The script "define_search.py" contains the basic functionality to perform an automatic search.

# UPDATE 17/09/2018: IT WORKS AGAIN. Better functions are being added, also following a clean-code way, TDD and object-oriented stuff are coming soon! In the next few days will be also added the way it does a search periodically...

# WARNING: This code is based on the WallaPop web of 2016. The scraping process probably fails now
# Please, check how to configure a Telegram Bot before using it. 
# This is an alpha version of the code. Modifications and updates will be available soon. Also, please feel free to suggest any changes!
# Have fun!
